\section{Purpose}
The software project module in 2017 at the university of Constance focuses on the development of app for mobile devices. \\
Especially, this Pflichtenheft intends to describe the structure of an implementation of a virtual reality representation of BLE sensor feedback.

\subsection{Mandatory Criteria}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[M1] The app shall use the Bluetooth adapter of the smartphone to connect to a TI SimpleLink SensorTag device.
  \item[M2] The app shall track the position of a TI SimpleLink SensorTag device with up to 30m tolerance.
  \item[M3] The app shall visualize the sensors' data and its position using 3D/stereoscopy, more concrete the WebVR framework.
  \item[M4] The visualization mentioned in M3 shall be explorable by tilting the joystick of a bluetooth controller
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Desired Criteria}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A1] The app shall visualize the sensors' data and its position using augmented reality
  \item[A2] The VR-World represents a whole corridor with more then two rooms.
\end{itemize}
