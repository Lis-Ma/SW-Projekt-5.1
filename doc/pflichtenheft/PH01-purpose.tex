\section{Purpose}
The software project module in 2017 at the University of Constance focuses on the development of an app for mobile devices. \\
Especially, this Pflichtenheft intends to describe the structure of an implementation of a virtual reality representation of BLE sensor feedback.

\subsection{Mandatory Criteria}

\begin{description}
  \item[M1] The app shall use the Bluetooth adapter of the smartphone to connect to a TI SimpleLink SensorTag device.
  \item[M2] The app shall track the position of a TI SimpleLink SensorTag device with up to 30m tolerance.
  \item[M3] The app shall visualize the sensors' data and its position using 3D/stereoscopy, more concrete the WebVR framework.
  \item[M4] The visualization mentioned in M3 shall be explorable by tilting the joystick of a bluetooth controller.
  \item[M5] The VR-World shall represent at least two different rooms and a connecting hallway.
  \item[M7] The data from the sensor shall have two different representations in the VR-World.
  \item[M8] The app shall provide a live data view of the sensor feedback in human readable form.

\end{description}

\subsection{Desired Criteria}

\begin{description}
  \item[A1] The app shall visualize the sensors' data and its position using augmented reality.
  \item[A2] The VR-World shall represent a whole corridor with more than two rooms.
  \item[A3] The app shall store the sensors' data and give a time lapse of the data inside the VR-World.
\end{description}
